# Hi there, I'm Eduardo Cano García! 👋

I'm a **Mechatronics Engineering student** at **Universidad Autónoma Chapingo** (4th year), passionate about bridging the gap between agriculture and technology (AgTech). I am currently transitioning into **Embedded Systems** and **Cybersecurity**.

## 🚀 Who am I?
I am an engineer in training who loves solving complex problems in the field and in the code. My background involves heavy machinery analysis, but my focus is shifting towards:
* **IoT & Embedded Systems** (ESP32, Sensors)
* **Data Science applied to Agriculture** (Psychrometrics, Computer Vision)
* **Cybersecurity** (Network analysis, Malware analysis habits)

## 🔭 What am I currently working on?
* 🌱 **Plant Wearables:** Developing a Heat Ratio Method (HRM) sensor to measure sap flow in plants using resistance heaters and precision temperature sensors.
* 🌡️ **Digital Psychrometer:** Building a portable device with ESP32, RTC, and SD logging to calculate wet/dry bulb temperatures in real-time.
* 💧 **Smart Water Management:** Designing a pumping sump unit for the CERONA irrigation project.
* ☕ **Coffee Maturity Classifier:** A Computer Vision project to classify coffee beans by color.
* 🛡️ **Cybersecurity Upskilling:** consistently learning via TryHackMe and building networking knowledge (OSI Model, DHCP).

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python (Machine Learning/Data), C/C++ (Embedded).
* **Hardware:** ESP32, PLCs, Sensors (Temperature/Humidity), Agricultural Machinery (John Deere/Case IH knowledge).
* **Areas:** Psychrometrics, Machine Learning (Regression/Classifiers), Computer Networking.

## 📫 How to reach me?
I am looking for an **Internship / Professional Stay starting January 2026** focused on Embedded Systems, Cybersecurity, or Data Science.
